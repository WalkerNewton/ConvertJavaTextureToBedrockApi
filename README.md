# API for convert Minecraft Java texture packs to Bedrock texture packs

## Description

Look at https://github.com/WalkerNewton/ConvertJavaTextureToBedrock#user-content-description

## Requirements

This is an "ES module"

So it requires a current web browser or NodeJS v14

If you need older support, please try to use something like `webpack` or `babel`

## Use it direct in your code

Add it as a dependency to your `package.json`

```bash
yarn add @ozelot379/convert-minecraft-java-texture-to-bedrock-api
```

You can convert your texture packs like

```javascript
import {ConsoleLog, Input, LocalFileInputEntry, LocalFileOutput} from "@ozelot379/convert-base-api";
import {ConvertJavaTextureToBedrockApi} from "@ozelot379/convert-minecraft-java-texture-to-bedrock-api";

(async () => {
    let output;

    try {
        output = await new ConvertJavaTextureToBedrockApi(new Input(new LocalFileInputEntry("input/java_texture_pack.zip")), new LocalFileOutput("output/bedrock_texture_pack.mcpack"), new ConsoleLog()).convert();
    } catch (err) {
        console.err(err);

        return;
    }

    console.log(`Output: ${output}`);
})();
```

## Extras (for texture pack creators)

### UUID

You can create the `bedrock_uuid_header` and `bedrock_uuid_module` files in your input, to keep the same uuid on repeating conversions - otherwise, random uuids are generated each time and you need to reselect the texture pack again in the game

### Custom textures

You can put custom textures in a `bedrock_textures` folder in your input

For instance for textures, that can not be converted or are not converted correctly

This files are applied additionally before output

## How this work

This project uses the follow main features or external libraries:

- [Web Worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API) for convert it in the background to not freeze the browser ui (Web app)
- [jszip](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jszip) for read, modify and write zip files
- [jimp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jimp) for graphic manipulation
- [file-saver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/file-saver) for deliver the converted pack to download (Web app)
- [webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack) for bundle the dist code (Web app)
- [Service Worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) for offline cache and usage (Web app)
